      The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticated</a> species that
      arose from the red junglefowl, originally from India.<br>
       They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey
      junglefowl, Ceylon junglefowl, and green junglefowl).<sup><a href="https://www.naver.com">[2]</a></sup> Rooster and cock
      are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
      cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird
      is called a hen, and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans
      keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and
      eggs) or as pets. Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting,
      which is still practiced in some places. Chickens domesticated for meat
      are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.

      Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with
      a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19
      billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
      There are numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and
      religion, as well as in language and literature.

      Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories within
      South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the
      Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa originated from the Indian
      subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern
      Mediterranean. They appear in ancient Egypt in the mid-15th century BC,
      with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land
      between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose
      III.[4][5][6] They are known in ancient Greece from the 5th century
      BC.[7][8]
